# Sea Of Thieves - TailwindCSS

This is merely meant as a learning project and nothing else. 

I decided to re-create the official Sea Of Thieves website utilizing TailwindCSS as a learning project.

Things I'm learning within this are:

* TailwindCSS
* CSS Architecture
* HTML5 and Semantics
* Javascript
* SASS
* Webpack
* Laravel Mix
* NPM

I figured doing an entire project with all of these concepts, meshing them together would help me learn a lot quicker.

I hope you guys enjoy.
